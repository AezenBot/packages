## ‚úÖ Usage of the Module
This module is made and used to support localization of Discord bots and other application. Here's an example of how you can use the [localization](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aezen/localization) module of Aezen.

### Prerequisites
- **Knowledge:** You must know how to use JavaScript, or how to code in general. It is unlikely that you will get help from using this module by making a new issue.
- **Node Version:** You must use the latest verion of node.
- **ECMAScript:** This module uses ESM. Therefore in order to use this module, your application must use an ES Module.

### Installation
```bash
npm install @aezen/localization
```
```bash
yarn add @aezen/localization
```
```bash
pnpm add @aezen/localization
```

### Folder Structure for the Languages
You can add more languages if you want. Only `.json` files are going to be recognized by the module.
```
languages/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tl.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fr.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ja.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ zh.json
```

### Example.js
```js
// Import the module
import Localization from "@aezen/localization";

// Create a new Localization class
const locale = new Localization(client, {
  /**
   * Where your languages are stored. You must specify the directory without the root directory.
   *
   * Other examples of path:
   * src/languages
   * src/bot/languages
   * modules/languages
   */
  path: "languages",
  autoReload: true, // If the module should auto reload the languages.
  autoReloadInterval: 3000 // The interval in milliseconds between reloading.
})

// IMPORTANT: This must be called, or else the
// languages won't load and the module won't work.
await locale.init();

// Now you can get translations! See the directory of the module for the rest of the functions
locale.getKey("en", "hello")
locale.getKey("en", "some.very.deep.path.object.to.the.translation")
```

### Example with placeholders
You must use `{}` if you wish to make a certain word act as a placeholder. To actually replace the placeholder in your JSON file, you can pass in a 3rd object parameter in the `getKey()` function.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è The placeholder must be the same with your 3rd parameter. See example below.

```js
locale.getKey("en", "introduction", {
  name: "Aezen",
  developer: "Ark",
  language: "Discord.JS"
})
```
```json
{
  "introduction": "Hello there, my name is {name}. I am developed by {developer} using {language}."
}
```
```
Hello there, my name is Aezen. I am developed by Ark using Discord.JS.
```
