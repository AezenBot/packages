## üìç Features
- Written with JavaScript ES Module.
- Supports more time units: decades, centuries, megayear, gigayear, and terayear.
- Added more duration formatter functions.
- Uses `bignumber.js` to handle large numbers when converting.
- Lightweight and easy-to-use.

## ‚úÖ Usage of the Module
This module is used to convert milleseconds into a human-readable string, and vice versa. Here's an example of how you can use the [duration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aezen/duration) module of Aezen.

### Prerequisites
- **Knowledge:** You must know how to use JavaScript, or how to code in general. It is unlikely that you will get help from using this module by making a new issue.
- **Node Version:** You must use the latest verion of node.
- **ECMAScript:** This module uses ESM. Therefore in order to use this module, your application must use an ES Module.

### Installation
```bash
npm install @aezen/duration
```
```bash
yarn add @aezen/duration
```
```bash
pnpm add @aezen/duration
```

### Example.js
```js
// Import the module
import { Duration } from "@aezen/duration";

// You can either use a string pattern or millesconds directly to the Duration class.
const converted = new Duration("an hour and 66 seconds");

console.log(converted.ms) // 3666000
console.log(converted.verbose()) // 1 hour 1 minute 6 seconds
console.log(converted.colon()) // 01:01:06 (HH:MM:SS format)
console.log(converted.compact()) // 1h  1m  6s
console.log(converted.elegant()) //  1 hour, 1 minute and 6 seconds
console.log(converted.binary()) // 111001010010
console.log(converted.scientific()) // 3.666e+6
console.lof(converted.object())
```

### Time Unit Calculations
If you think something is wrong with this calculation, feel free to open an issue. Thank you.
```js
export const CommonFactor = new BigNumber(1000).times(60).times(60).times(24)

export const Time = {
  Nanosecond: new BigNumber(1e-6),
  Microsecond: new BigNumber(1e-3),
  Millisecond: new BigNumber(1),
  Second: new BigNumber(1000),
  Minute: new BigNumber(1000).times(60),
  Hour: new BigNumber(1000).times(60).times(60),
  Day: CommonFactor,
  Week: CommonFactor.times(7),
  Year: CommonFactor.times(365),
  Month: CommonFactor.times(30.436875),
  Decade: CommonFactor.times(365).times(10),
  Century: CommonFactor.times(365).times(100),
  Millennium: CommonFactor.times(365).times(1000),
  Megayear: CommonFactor.times(365).times(1e6),
  Gigayear: CommonFactor.times(365).times(1e9),
  Terayear: CommonFactor.times(365).times(1e12)
};
